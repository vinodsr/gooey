    2 . In the onload handler of the window add this code

            db.setfile("mydata.db");  // the database file..
            db.setfield("name",t_name); // Assign fields to textbox
            db.setfield("age",t_age);  // t_name and t_age..
            .  .
            .  .
            db.connect();         //Connects the database..
    3 . In the close hanlder of the window add this code

            db.commit();  // Write the buffer into the file.

    4 . The member functions available are ..
